## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming convention

### What I learned

I realized that it is hard to write all the CSS of a landing page without using Sass/SCSS.

### Continued development

I will focus on utilizing Sass/SCSS to make my code, as well as my files, organized.
